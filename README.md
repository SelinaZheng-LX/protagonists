# Welcome to Team Protagonist's Battle of the CUNYs

***
About: A web-based game for CUNY students to develop their soft skills and encourage students to market themselves while aiding in career development.

At the end of a semester or year, a major battle will ensue, and the CUNY with the strongest spirit wins!
